# Agent Chatter

**Orchestrate multi-agent AI conversations effortlessly.**

Agent Chatter is a powerful CLI application that enables structured conversations between multiple AI assistants (Claude, Codex, Gemini) and human participants. Let your AI agents collaborate, discuss, and solve problems together while you observe and guide the conversation.

## Why Agent Chatter?

- 🤖 **Multi-AI Collaboration**: Run Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Google Gemini in coordinated conversations
- 💬 **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic turn-taking or explicit addressing with `[NEXT: ...]` markers
- 🧠 **Context Awareness**: Each agent receives recent conversation history for coherent discussions
- 👥 **Human-in-the-loop**: Mix AI agents with human participants seamlessly
- ⚙️ **Flexible Configuration**: JSON-based team and agent setup for any workflow
- 🎯 **Production Ready**: Clean architecture designed for reliability and extensibility

## Key Features

### Automatic Conversation Flow
Agents take turns responding in round-robin fashion, or explicitly address each other by name. No manual copy-pasting between different AI tools.

### Context Management
Every agent receives the recent conversation history, ensuring coherent multi-turn discussions with full context awareness.

### Extensible Architecture
Add support for any AI CLI tool through simple wrapper scripts. Standard stdin/stdout interface makes integration straightforward.

### Mixed Teams
Combine multiple AI agents with human observers or participants. Perfect for AI-assisted brainstorming, code review, or complex problem-solving.

## System Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 20 or higher (LTS recommended)
- **Operating System**:
  - macOS (fully supported)
  - Linux (fully supported)
  - Windows (requires WSL or Git Bash for wrapper scripts)
- **At least one AI CLI tool**: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, or Google Gemini CLI

### Platform Notes

- **macOS & Linux**: All features work natively
- **Windows**: For using wrapper scripts (Codex, Gemini), you need:
  - Option 1 (Recommended): Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
  - Option 2: Git Bash
  - Option 3: Use `.bat` wrapper scripts (included for Windows)

npx agent-chatter start -c config.json -m "Your message"
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Configuration File

Create `my-team.json`:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "claude",
      "command": "claude",
      "args": [
        "--append-system-prompt",
        "Always end your response with [DONE] on a new line. Keep responses concise."
      ],
      "endMarker": "[DONE]",
      "usePty": false
    }
  ],
  "team": {
    "name": "my-ai-team",
    "displayName": "My AI Team",
    "description": "Claude with human observer",
    "instructionFile": "./teams/my-ai-team/team_instruction.md",
    "roleDefinitions": [
      {
        "name": "reviewer",
        "displayName": "Reviewer",
        "description": "AI reviewer that inspects the code"
      },
      {
        "name": "observer",
        "displayName": "Observer",
        "description": "Human teammate who can step in with clarifications"
      }
    ],
    "members": [
      {
        "displayName": "Claude Reviewer",
        "displayRole": "Reviewer",
        "name": "claude-reviewer",
        "type": "ai",
        "role": "reviewer",
        "agentType": "claude",
        "themeColor": "cyan",
        "roleDir": "./teams/my-ai-team/reviewer/claude-reviewer",
        "workDir": "./teams/my-ai-team/reviewer/claude-reviewer/work",
        "instructionFile": "./teams/my-ai-team/reviewer/claude-reviewer/AGENTS.md"
      },
      {
        "displayName": "Human Observer",
        "displayRole": "Observer",
        "name": "observer-1",
        "type": "human",
        "role": "observer",
        "themeColor": "green",
        "roleDir": "./teams/my-ai-team/observer/human-observer",
        "workDir": "./teams/my-ai-team/observer/human-observer/work",
        "instructionFile": "./teams/my-ai-team/observer/human-observer/README.md"
      }
    ]
  },
  "maxRounds": 10
}
```

> **Note:** Agent Chatter 从一开始就只支持 `schemaVersion: "1.0"`。若你手上还有早期草稿（例如 `team.roles` 结构），请参考本文档重新创建配置或使用 `/team create` 向导；本项目不提供旧版配置的自动迁移工具。

### 2. Start a Conversation

```bash
agent-chatter start -c my-team.json -m "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"
```

Claude will respond, then pause for your input. The conversation continues with full context awareness.

## Use Cases

### AI-Assisted Code Review
Multiple AI agents review code from different perspectives (security, performance, maintainability), with a human making final decisions.

### Brainstorming Sessions
Agents with different "personalities" or specializations discuss ideas, generating diverse perspectives on complex problems.

### Multi-Step Problem Solving
Break down complex tasks into steps, with different agents specializing in different aspects (research, implementation, testing).

### Knowledge Synthesis
Agents discuss a topic from different angles, synthesizing information from their different training approaches and capabilities.

## Configuration Reference

### Agent Configuration

Each agent in the `agents` array:

```json
{
  "name": "unique-id",
  "command": "cli-command",
  "args": ["--arg1", "--arg2"],
  "endMarker": "[DONE]"
}
```

- `name`: Unique identifier
- `command`: CLI executable path
- `args`: Command-line arguments (optional)
- `endMarker`: Text marking response completion

### Team Configuration

Define your team structure:

```json
{
  "team": {
    "name": "team-name",
    "displayName": "Team Name",
    "description": "Team description",
    "instructionFile": "./teams/team-name/team_instruction.md",
    "roleDefinitions": [...],
    "members": [...]
  },
  "maxRounds": 10
}
```

### Member Configuration

Each participant entry in `team.members` must define directories and the instruction file to use:

```json
{
  "displayName": "Claude Reviewer",
  "displayRole": "Reviewer",
  "name": "claude-reviewer",
  "type": "ai",
  "role": "reviewer",
  "agentType": "claude",
  "roleDir": "./teams/team-name/reviewer/claude-reviewer",
  "workDir": "./teams/team-name/reviewer/claude-reviewer/work",
  "instructionFile": "./teams/team-name/reviewer/claude-reviewer/AGENTS.md"
}
```

- `agentType`: References an entry in the top-level `agents` array (e.g., `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`).
- `roleDir`: Anchor directory for this member. The instruction file and work directory typically live under this tree.
- `workDir`: Directory the process should treat as its working directory (symlink it to your actual project if needed).
- `instructionFile`: Path to the Markdown instructions that define this member's role-specific persona.
- `env`: Optional extra environment variables merged into the spawned CLI. Note: All CLI agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini) use the system HOME directory for credentials.

### Conversation Control

Agents and humans control the conversation flow through markers:

**Message Routing:**
- **No marker**: Automatic round-robin to next role
- **`[NEXT: role-name]`**: Route to specific participant
- **`[NEXT: alice, bob]`**: Route to multiple participants

**Conversation Completion:**
- **AI agents**: When an AI outputs `[DONE]`, it only indicates that agent's reply is complete. The conversation continues to the next member.
- **Human members**: When a human sends a message with `[DONE]`, the conversation terminates.
- **Commands**: Use the `/end` command to manually terminate a conversation at any time.

> **Note**: This design allows AI agents to collaborate continuously while giving humans full control over when to end the session.

## Examples

### Example 1: Single AI + Human

Start a conversation with Claude, then interact as needed:

```bash
agent-chatter start -c claude-config.json -m "Help me design a REST API"
```

### Example 2: Multiple AI Agents

Three agents (Claude, Codex, Gemini) discuss technical architecture:

```bash
agent-chatter start -c multi-agent.json -m "Design a distributed caching system"
```

Agents automatically take turns, building on each other's responses.

### Example 3: Code Review Team

Configure agents with different specializations:
- Agent 1: Security focus
- Agent 2: Performance focus
- Agent 3: Code quality focus
- Human: Final reviewer

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom AI Wrapper Scripts

#### For macOS/Linux

Create a bash wrapper script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# my-ai-wrapper.sh
prompt=$(cat)
my-ai-tool --prompt "$prompt" 2>/dev/null
echo ""
echo "[DONE]"
```

#### For Windows

Create a batch wrapper script:

```batch
@echo off
REM my-ai-wrapper.bat
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
set "prompt="
for /f "delims=" %%i in ('more') do set "prompt=!prompt!%%i"
my-ai-tool --prompt "%prompt%" 2>nul
echo.
echo [DONE]
endlocal
```

#### Configuration

Reference the wrapper in your config (use appropriate extension for your platform):

```json
{
  "name": "my-ai",
  "command": "./wrappers/my-ai-wrapper.sh",  // or .bat for Windows
  "args": [],
  "endMarker": "[DONE]"
}
```

### Context Window Control

Adjust how much conversation history agents receive by modifying `contextMessageCount` in the coordinator (default: 5 messages).

## Troubleshooting

**Agent not responding?**
- Verify the CLI tool is installed and in PATH
- Check the `command` path in your configuration
- Ensure `endMarker` matches the agent's actual output

**Process hangs?**
- Verify wrapper scripts properly close stdin
- Check that the agent CLI supports non-interactive mode
- Confirm the `endMarker` is being sent

**Context issues?**
- Verify messages are being logged in the session
- Check that `contextMessageCount` is appropriate for your use case

## System Requirements

- Node.js 18 or higher
- macOS, Linux, or Windows WSL
