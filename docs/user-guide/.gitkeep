# User Guide Directory

This directory contains work-in-progress user documentation and reference materials.

**Note:** This directory is excluded from version control (.gitignore) to keep the repository focused on application code.

## Contents

- `wrappers/` - Reference implementations of wrapper scripts for Codex and Gemini CLI integration
- More user guides will be added here as documentation develops

## For Developers

This is a local workspace for accumulating user-facing documentation that doesn't belong in the main codebase.
